	<div class="d2">A beach is a landform alongside a body of water which consists of loose particles. The particles composing a beach are typically made from rock, such as sand, gravel, shingle, pebbles, etc., or biological sources, such as mollusc shells or coralline algae. They are formed when weathered and eroded material gets deposited by sea waves to an area. Some are breeding grounds for sea turtles or nesting areas for seabirds or penguins and are places where we can relax with our family and friends.
