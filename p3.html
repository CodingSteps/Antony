<h2>Death</h2>
<p>Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated on <u>30<sup>th</sup> January 1948</u> in the compound of <i>Birla Gandhiâ€™s House</i> (now Gandhi Smriti), a large mansion in New Delhi. His assassin was <mark>Nathuram Vinayak Godse</mark>, <i>an advocate of Hindu nationalism, a member of the political party - the Hindu Mahasabha, and a former member of the Hindu nationalist volunteer organisation Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)</i>. Godse considered Gandhiji to have been too accommodating to Muslims during the Partition of India of the previous year. Before he was assasinated, Gandhiji was reaching the top of the steps leading to the raised lawn behind the Birla House where he had been conducting <i>multi-faith prayer meetings</i> every evening. As Gandhiji began to walk towards the dais, Godse stepped out and fired three bullets into his chest and abdomen. Gandhiji fell to the ground and died.</p>
