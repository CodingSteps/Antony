<p><b>Dinosaurs</b> are huge creatures that existed millions of years ago. They varied in <b>size, shape and colour</b>. Some can even reach the size of tall buildings! Just like modern-day animals, these creatures were also divided into <u>herbivores, carnivores, omnivores and scavengers</u>. Different dinosaurs lived in <i>different continents</i>, even Antarctica!</p>

<h2> <span style="color: green" id="How was the earth like when they existed?"> How was the earth like</span> when they existed?</h2>
<p> In the <mark>Triassic Period</mark>, the earth had a supercontinent namd <i>Pangaea</i>. All the continents were connected to each other. But at that time India was not with Asia that time. Also, at that time, there was only one ocean, the <i>Tethys Ocean</i>. Also, Pangaea had no ice caps and the land was hot and dry .Therefore, Pangaea was dominated by large areas of desert. The name comes from two Greek words "<i>pan</i>" and "<i>gaia</i>" which means "<mark>All Earth</mark>". There were ony brown and green plants and trees that time like <b>Cycad, Gingko leaves, Monkey puzzle and Horsetail.</b></p>
<center><img src="file:///C:/Users/Antony%20Hansel/Documents/GitHub/Antony/images/pangaea.png" width= "250" height="250 " ></center>
<br>
<p> In the <mark>Jurassic Period</mark>, Pangaea seperated into 2 smaller supercontinents, <i>Laurasia and Gondwana</i>. Laurasia consists of Eurasia and North America and Gondwana consists of Africa, South America, Australia, Antarctica and even India, which was still not with Asia yet.</p>
<center><img src="file:///C:/Users/Antony%20Hansel/Documents/GitHub/Antony/images/Picture1.png" width="300" height="250"></center>
<br>
<p>In the <mark>Cretaceous Period</mark>, all the continents finally seperated from each, but they were not in their shapes we see today yet. And still, India was not connected to Asia, but was moving towards it. Also, 3 more oceans appeared - Pacific, Arctic and Atlantic Ocean. Later, after the dinosaurs went extinct, India finally came in contact with Asia and the Tethys Ocean disappeared and the Southern and Indian Ocean appeared as we can see today. This change of landmass happened due to the <i>tectonic plates</i> which always move, therefore, changing the shape of the land. This is when the first flowers appeared like <b>magnolias and passion flowers</b>.</p>

<p>The first dinosaur fossils were recognized in the early 19th century, and in <i>1841</i>, <mark>Sir Richard Owen</mark> coined the name '<i>Dinosaur</i>' which means '<i>Terrible Lizard</i>'. Since then, dinosaur fossils had been major attractions at museums worldwide and books about them appeared and movies like "Jurassic Park" came. We also know about dinosaurs from fossil evidence.</p>

<h2><span style="color: indigo;: " id="Types of dinosaurs">Types</span> of Dinosaurs</h2>
<p>Dinosaurs are divided into two types based on their hip bones: <b>Saurischians (Lizard-hipped) and Ornithischians (Bird-hipped)</b>. Saurischians had a pair of hip bones that pointed <i>forwards or down</i>. Ornithischians had a pair of hip bones pointing <i>back</i>. All theropods are saurischians, but sauropods were saurischians as well. Ornithischians were all herbivores. Everything was normal until 2018 when all the theropods (except for herrerasaurids) were put in a newly-made group called <b>Ornithoscelida</b> along with Ornithischians as they were closely related to Ornithischia. The table below shows the classification of dinosaurs in present day.</p>

<p>Dinosaurs were of different sizes, some were as small as rabbits, others were as huge as tall buildings! The smallest was the <b>Mussasaurus baby</b>, which was around 8 inches long. The largest was the <b>Argentinosaurus</b> which was as long as 3 to 4 buses and is as tall as a 4-storey building!</p>

<h2 style="color: grey" id="Reproduction">Reproduction</h2>
<p>Just like birds, dinosaurs laid <mark>eggs</mark> as well. They had hard and brittle shells. They were of different shapes and sizes. Small dinosaurs sat on them like birds today. Big dinosaurs didn't do so as the egg will smash into pieces. So, they laid eggs in small pits and covered them in <em>earth and leaves</em>. The largest eggs were laid by the <b>Macroelongatoolihus xixiaeinsis</b>. </p>

<h2 style="color: darkred" id="Theropods">Theropods</h2>
<p>Carnivorous Dinosaurs were known as "Theropods" which means "Beast-Footed". Some dinosaurs hunted alone while some hunted in packs. However, not all of them were carnivores. Some were omnivores or herbivores as well. Let's look at some of them here.</p>
<br>
<h3 style="color: grey" id="Dromaeosaurs">Dromaeosaurs</h3>
<p><u>Dromaeosaurs</u> were raptors which were <i>two-legged and carnivorous</i>. They had scales and some even had feathers! They hunted in packs so that they can bring down large herbivores as well. The following dinosaurs here are dromaeosaurs. </p>
<h3 style="color: grey" id="Velociraptor">Velociraptor</h3>
<p><mark>Velociraptor</mark> means "<i>Speedy Thief</i>". It lived <u>70 MYA</u> in the <u>Late Cretaceous Period</u>. Its fossils were found in <b>China, Russia and Mongolia</b>. It was 5-6 feet long and weighed 15 kgs. It had 80 sharp bladed teeth. It had large eyes which gave it <u>excellent vision</u> in the dark. It hunted in packs so it could bring down large herbivores. It ran <i>37 mph</i> so it can outrun its prey. It also had a <b>sickle-shaped claw</b> on its feet which could be used to <em>stab its prey</em> causing the prey much blood loss which could lead to death. Before stabbing its prey, it jumped at a height of <i>12 feet</i> off the ground to pounce and attack. There was even a fossil of Velociraptor and Protoceratops fighting in the Gobi Desert. Both of them seemed to have died in a sudden sandstorm, preserving the battle forever.</p>

Its tail was stiffenned by a lattice of bony rods and was flexible at the base so it could be moved up and down. The tail is used for balance while running. It had a large head, containing a big brain. It had <u>excellent vision</u> due to its large eyes and also had a <u>strong sense of smell</u> and <u>good hearing</u> making it an efficient hunter. Its had long, razor sharp teeth. Its bite force was more powerful than velociraptor's. It had sickle-shaped claws on each finger which is used to slash its prey. The claws on the foot were used to do some terrible damage to its prey.</p>

Its tail was stiff which helped it to balance and attack prey. It had three curved claws on each hand which was long and sharp. They were used to <i>climb trees while escaping from predators</i>. It had 4 toes on each foot with claws at the end. The second claw was 13 cm long which was why Deinonychus got its name. The <b>sickle-shaped claw</b> was used to stab its prey, then waited for it to bleed to death. </p>

<p><mark>Caudipteryx</mark> means "<i>Tail feather</i>" or "<i>winged tail</i>". It lived <u>124.6 MYA</u> in the <u>Early Cretaceous Period</u>. Its fossils were found in <b>China</b>.

It had short arms for grasping. These arms had three fingers wtih claws up to 8 cms long. It had a <b>flexible neck, long tail and a parrot-shaped jaw</b>. It didn't have any teeth but its jaws were powerful and modified for crushing its food, so it ate <b>meat, plants, insects, small reptiles and shellfish</b>. It also had a crest on its snout to attract females. The reason why this dinosaur was named Oviraptor is because one of its fossils showed that it was near a nest with eggs and scientists thought it was stealing eggs, hence the nameas given. However, later studies have shown that <u>the nest belonged to the Oviraptor itself and was actually protecting its eggs</u>. </p>
