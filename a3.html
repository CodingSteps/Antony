		<p>Dahl was born in Wales to Norwegian immigrant parents, and spent most of his life in England. He served in the Royal Air Force (RAF) during the Second World War. He became a fighter pilot and, subsequently, an intelligence officer, rising to the rank of acting wing commander. He rose to prominence as a writer in the 1940s with works for children and for adults, and he became one of the world's best-selling authors. He has been referred to as "One of the greatest storytellers for children of the 20th century". His awards for contribution to literature include the 1983 World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement; and the British Book Awards' Children's Author of the Year in 1990. In 2008, The Times placed Dahl 16th on its list of "The 50 Greatest British Writers Since 1945". However, he and his work have been criticised for antisemitism, racism and misogyny.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>James and the Giant Peach</li>
				<li>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</li>

				<li>The Witches</li>

		<h1>Early Life</h1>
		<p>Roald Dahl was born in 1916 at Villa Marie, Fairwater Road, in Llandaff, Cardiff, Wales, to Norwegians Harald Dahl (1863–1920) and Sofie Magdalene Dahl (1885–1967). Dahl's father had immigrated to the UK from Sarpsborg in Norway and settled in Cardiff in the 1880s with his first wife, a Frenchwoman named Marie Beaurin-Gresser. They had two children together (Ellen Marguerite and Louis) before her death in 1907. His mother immigrated to the UK and married his father in 1911. Dahl was named after Norwegian polar explorer Roald Amundsen. His first language was Norwegian, which he spoke at home with his parents and his sisters Astri, Alfhild, and Else. The children were raised in Norway's Lutheran state church, the Church of Norway, and were baptised at the Norwegian Church, Cardiff. His grandmother Ellen Wallace was a descendant of an early 18th-century Scottish immigrant to Norway. Dahl's father was a wealthy shipbroker who left behind a fortune of £150,000 (about £4.5 million in 2016) when he died in 1920.</p>

		<h1>School</h1>
		<h3>Llandaff Cathedral School</h3>
		<p>From the age of eight, Dahl attended <u>Llandaff Cathedral School</u> in Cardiff. He and his friends had a grudge against the local sweet-shop owner, Mrs Pratchett, an unpleasant, elderly woman who gave no thought to hygiene. They played a prank on her by placing a dead mouse in a jar while his friend Thwaites distracted her by buying sweets. They were caned by the headmaster as a punishment, after Mrs Pratchett identified Dahl and his friends as the pupils who were responsible for this incident. Mrs Pratchett, who sat in the headmaster's office to watch the canings, was not satisfied after the first stroke was delivered and insisted the headmaster should cane much harder which he did: six of the hardest strokes he could muster while Mrs Pratchett beamed with great delight as each boy suffered his punishment.</p>
		<h3>St Peter's School</h3>
		<p>From the age of 9, Dahl attended St Peter's School, a boarding school in Weston-super-Mare. He describes having received six strokes of the cane after being accused of cheating at his classwork. In the essay "The Life Story of a Penny", he claims that he still has the essay and that he had been doing well until the nib of his pen broke and fountain pens were not permitted at the school. He had to ask his classmate for another one when Captain Hardcastle heard him and accused him of cheating, issuing him with a "stripe", meaning that the next morning he received six strokes of the cane from the headmaster, who refused to believe Dahl's version of events on the basis of Captain Hardcastle's status. He was also homesick in the beginning and tried faking appendicitis.</p>
		<h3>Repton School</h3>
		<p>As Dahl came to the end of his time at St Peter's, Roald's mother entered him for either Marlborough or Repton, but he chose Repton because it was easier to pronounce. Dahl soon realised that Marlborough may have been a better choice, as life at Repton was difficult and cruel. The prefects, named Boazers as per school tradition, were utmost sadists and patrolled the school like secret police. The headmaster treated students similarly. According to Dahl, this headmaster was Geoffrey Francis Fisher, who later became Archbishop of Canterbury and Bishop of London in 1939. The headmaster concerned was in fact John Traill Christie, Fisher's successor. Despite his difficulties at school, Dahl did make friends with the Maths professor and a pupil called Michael. Even one of the Boazers, Wilberforce, took a liking to Dahl. Despite it being punishment for Dahl's tardiness, Wilberforce was impressed by how Dahl warmed his lavatory seat that he hired him as his personal lavatory warmer. Dahl also excelled in sports and photography, something he says impressed various masters at the school.</p>
